The road gets tougher now that you’re a Ninja. But if I told you that, I guess it would ruin the moment. So I’ll tell you later. Over 500 bowls of Ramen.\\n  Give it up.  You’re just bent, because you didn’t have the guts to do what I do. Do ya!? Losers! Wanabees! You’ll never catch me! ',\n",

I mean, you know who the Hokage are, don’t you?\\n Course I do.  Everybody knows. They were the greatest Shinobi of their time, right? The best of the best. Undefeated Ninja champs.   And the Fourth Hokage’s the one who saved the village from the Nine-Tailed Fox. He was the most amazing.',\n",
